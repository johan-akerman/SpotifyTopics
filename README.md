## üìñ Story behind the project
During the summer of 2020 I participated in Spotify's summer hackathon. The challenge was to develop something with their API and record a 3 minute pitch. As a big fan of podcasts, I chose to develop a new way to listen to them. I often use podcasts as a tool to learn new things and in order to do that more efficiently I felt a need of getting an overview of the various topics / content discussed in each episode. For example, I may discover a 40 minute long podcast but I am actually only interested in a segment that is discussed between minute 23 and 25. Therefore, I developed a tool that let's you fastforward to specific timestamps where certain topics are being discussed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies used
React JS, the Spotify Web API and Bootstrap.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è PS
This was one of the first projects working with git. As a result I made some mistakes and therefore some of the source code is missing. Well, atleast I learnt from my mistakes :)
