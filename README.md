# Spotify Topics
My contribution to the "Spotify Ramp Up Summer 2020" challenge. During the summer I developed a timestamp based navigation system for podcasts. More specifically, the tool allows the user to easily get an overview of the content of a podcast. The tool also provides a convenient way to fastforward to specific timestamps where certain topics are being discussed. This is done either by clicking on the progressbar in the player or on the desired topic in the sidebar (see screenshots below).  The tool was mainly build with React JS, the Spotify Web API and Bootstrap.
