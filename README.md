# Spotify Topics
My contribution to the "Spotify Ramp Up Summer 2020" challenge. During the summer I developed a timestamp based navigation system for podcasts. More specifically, the tool allows the user to easily get an overview of the content of a podcast and fastforward to specific timestamps where certain topics are being discussed. The tool was mainly build with React JS, the Spotify Web API and Bootstrap.
